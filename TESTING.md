# Testing

## Feature-wave regression gate

Run `ruff format --check .`, `ruff check .`, `mypy src`, `pytest`, and `python -m build` after installing `.[dev]` in an isolated environment. The focused regressions are in `tests/test_feature_wave.py`; run them together with the existing suite. Keep the configured coverage threshold. Repository CI supplies the supported OS/Python matrix.
